	<p class="mainContent aboutMe">Hi! This is <b>Michelle Manadero</b>, a 19-year old BS Information Technology student at Asia Pacific College.
	<br><br>People say that the only person who knows you the best is <b>yourself</b> and I agree to that. However, it would be awkward for me to describe myself here on my own page because I might end up on two results - be too harsh on myself or be too flattering to the point that you'll think I'm such a perfect girl. So, I dare you to just figure out the kind of person I am based on what you see and read here on my page!</p>
	<p class="mainContent aboutTitle">As time passes by, things become more and more significant. This has been the reason why I love the word <b>classic</b>. It saves us from the negative thought of how we cannot go back in time. So, to let ourselves feel better, just think about how people give a bigger value to something that is old, classic rather. And I want to be that something. I want to be loved and remembered even though I am too old in age. 
	<br><br>I came into this world as nothing and I don't want to leave the same way. And by the way,<b> missy</b>'s my nickname!</p>
